# Slug-Bros
A side scrolling shooter completed for a school assignment. The project was created by a team of three people, including myself.
Slug Bros was coded in C# in the XNA design environment.
It is a side scrolling shooter that takes gameplay inspiration from the popular arcade game Metal Slug and visual aesthetic from
the hit game Super Mario Bros.
